# Introduction:
Prometheus is a open-source platform for monitoring hardware and services. It collects metrics from the system of any other services that we configured.
# Prereusites
- Linux machine
- Docker and Docker compose installed.

## Setup:
In this repo we are going to see how to setup monitoring of a linux machine.

Iâ€™m going to use Docker to setup this process, however you can install binaries as usual. The docker compose consists of multiple components.

- First setup - Prometheus with Grafan. Viewing Server resources usgae using Node Exporter.
- Second setup - Prometheus alert manager for mail alerts for server usage.
- Third setup - Prometheus Blackbox exporter setup to view and monitor website metrics. Also sendd alerts.
